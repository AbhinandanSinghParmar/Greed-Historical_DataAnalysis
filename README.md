# Greed-Historical_DataAnalysis
This project analyzes the relationship between Bitcoin market sentiment and trader performance using real-world trading data. The objective is to understand how sentiment impacts trading behavior, risk-taking, and profitability, and to extract insights that support sentiment-aware trading strategies.

Data Sources
Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index: Daily sentiment scores and classifications (Extreme Fear, Fear, Greed, Extreme Greed).
Hyperliquid Historical Trader Data: Trade-level records including execution price, trade size, side (BUY/SELL), fees, timestamps, and realized PnL.

Approach
Cleaned and preprocessed both datasets, handling missing and inconsistent values.
Aligned trade timestamps with daily sentiment data.
Engineered key performance metrics such as net PnL, profitability indicators, and risk-adjusted returns.
Conducted exploratory analysis to compare trader behavior across different sentiment phases.
Applied statistical tests to evaluate differences in performance between Fear and Greed market conditions.

Key Findings
Trades during Fear and Extreme Fear phases tend to exhibit better risk-adjusted performance.
Greed and Extreme Greed phases are associated with increased trade size, aggressive execution, and higher losses.
Market sentiment significantly influences trader behavior, execution style, and overall performance.

Conclusion
The results show that incorporating market sentiment into trading and risk management decisions can improve consistency and reduce drawdowns. This analysis highlights the value of sentiment-aware strategies in cryptocurrency trading.
